===========STEP_1===============
1. Learn how to write logical formulae in LaTeX. 
2. We will be storing a logical formula as a tree as discussed in class.
3. Make routines to convert an input LaTeX formula to tree format and to print a formula in tree format in LaTeX.
4. Make routine allowing your theorem prover to display LaTeX formulas  in a window after compilation.
5. Given a tree representing a formula, find all free variable occurrences, all bound variable occurrences, and for each bound occurrence find the quantifier which bounds it.
6. Given a formula, list all variables which have at least one free occurrence in the formula.
7. Make a routine which when given a finite world W, finds out whether a given formula is true in W.
